# Introductory Web Design course

This course aims to introduce the main instruments used in web design, with special emphasis on HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages.

I thank MDN, Google Developers, W3C Schools and the other resources, reported several times along the attached slides, for providing me all the precious material that I used for building this little but very practical introductory course, whose instruments will let the attendants to go on with the subject on their own.

Please report me any errors on the slides - also, any tips are well seen by the Author.

Have a nice lecture!
